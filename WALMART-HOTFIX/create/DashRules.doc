General Rules:
Required Fields for All Entries:

type (either product or variant)
id (unique identifier)
sku (stock keeping unit)
name (display name)
enabled (1 if the item is active, 0 otherwise)
slug (URL-friendly name, optional for variants)
Parent-Child Relationships:

Products (type = product) do not require a parent_sku.
Variants (type = variant) must include a parent_sku linking to their parent product.
Rules for product Entries:
Core Fields:

Must include id, sku, name, and enabled.
Optional fields: slug and description.
Purpose:

Represents a standalone product or a grouping of variants.
Exclusions:

Does not include fields like items, variant_type, or download_link.
Rules for variant Entries:
Core Fields:

Must include id, sku, parent_sku, and name.
Optional fields: slug, description, variant_type.
Additional Fields Based on variant_type:

Gift Message
Includes a description field (custom text for the gift message).
Does not require items or download_link.
Bundle
Requires an items field, listing included SKUs and their quantities.
Each bundled item must have:
item_sku (non-null)
item_qty (non-zero quantity)
Ebook
Must include download_link (URL to download the ebook).
Does not require items.
Simple (No Options)
Contains only the basic fields (id, sku, name, enabled, and parent_sku).
No additional fields like items or description.
Data-Specific Rules:
Item Fields (itemX_sku, itemX_qty, etc.):

Up to 40 bundled items are supported (e.g., item1_sku to item40_sku).
Only populate these fields if variant_type = Bundle.
Ensure both sku and qty are non-null and valid for each bundled item.
Enabled Status:

enabled = 1 for active entries.
enabled = 0 for inactive entries.
Slug Uniqueness:

Ensure slug is unique across all products to avoid URL conflicts.
Variants can share the parent product's slug if not explicitly defined.
Optional Fields:

Fields like description, download_link, and items are conditional based on the variant_type.
Validation Rules:
Parent SKU Validation:

Every variant must reference an existing product via parent_sku.
Consistency of Variant Type:

Ensure variant_type aligns with the expected fields:
Bundle → Requires items.
Gift Message → Requires description.
Ebook → Requires download_link.
Item Quantity Validation:

For Bundle variants, each itemX_qty must be a positive integer.
SKUs in itemX_sku must be valid and non-null.
Usage Scenarios:
Gift Messages: Limited to text-based customization, no additional items or links.
Bundles: Used for packaging multiple products; requires detailed items.
Ebooks: Digital products requiring a download link.
Simple Products: No options or additional requirements; only basic details needed.
